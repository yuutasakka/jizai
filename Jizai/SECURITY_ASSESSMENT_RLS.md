# Supabase RLS Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

**Status: ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY GAPS IDENTIFIED**

While Row Level Security (RLS) policies are properly defined in the database schema, the application systematically bypasses these security controls by using the service client (`supabaseService`) instead of the authenticated client (`supabase`). This creates significant security vulnerabilities.

## Current RLS Implementation Analysis

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Comprehensive RLS Policies**: All critical tables have RLS enabled
   - `vault_subscriptions`, `vaults`, `family_members`, `family_verifications`
   - `access_requests`, `access_grants`, `memory_albums`, `memories`, `print_exports`

2. **Well-Designed Policy Structure**:
   - Subscription policies: Users can only access their own subscriptions
   - Vault policies: Owners can manage, family members can view granted vaults
   - Memory policies: Proper access control with time-based grants
   - Helper functions: `current_user_id()` and `current_user_email()` for JWT extraction

3. **Principle of Least Privilege in Policies**: RLS policies follow minimal access patterns

### ❌ Critical Security Issues

#### 1. Systematic RLS Bypass
**Files affected**: 6 backend services extensively use `supabaseService`
- `index-vault-integration.mjs`: Vault creation, memory insertion
- `services/family-sharing-service.mjs`: 10+ bypass operations
- `services/notification-service.mjs`: 10+ bypass operations
- `services/subscription-service.mjs`: Pattern continues
- `services/print-export-service.mjs`: Storage operations bypass
- Config and other service files

**Impact**: RLS policies are completely ineffective as application bypasses them

#### 2. Application-Level Authorization Anti-Pattern
```javascript
// SECURITY ISSUE: Manual authorization check instead of using RLS
const { data: vault } = await supabaseService
  .from('vaults')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', vaultId)
  .eq('device_id', deviceId)  // ← Should be handled by RLS
  .single();
```

**Problem**: Authorization logic scattered across application code instead of centralized in database policies.

#### 3. Single Point of Failure
- All security relies on correct `deviceId → user.id` mapping
- If this mapping fails or is manipulated, unauthorized access is possible
- No database-level protection against privilege escalation

## Security Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK Issues

1. **Data Exposure Risk**: Bugs in application logic could expose unauthorized data
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Service client has admin privileges when user-level should suffice  
3. **Inconsistent Security Model**: Mixed approach between RLS and application-level checks
4. **Audit Trail Gap**: RLS bypasses are not logged or monitored

### MEDIUM RISK Issues

1. **Maintenance Burden**: Authorization logic distributed across multiple services
2. **Testing Complexity**: Security logic cannot be tested at database level
3. **Code Duplication**: Similar authorization patterns repeated across services

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Implement Proper JWT Authentication**
   ```javascript
   // Replace service client usage with authenticated client
   const supabaseAuth = supabase.auth.setSession(userJWT);
   const { data } = await supabase.from('vaults').select('*'); // RLS enforced
   ```

2. **Audit Service Client Usage**
   - Review all 30+ `supabaseService` calls
   - Identify legitimate admin operations vs. user operations
   - Replace user operations with authenticated client

3. **Add RLS Monitoring**
   ```javascript
   // Log when service client is used for user operations
   if (operation_type === 'user_data' && client === 'service') {
     secureLogger.warn('RLS bypassed for user operation', { operation, user_id });
   }
   ```

### Implementation Plan (Priority 2)

1. **Phase 1**: Replace critical user data operations
   - Vault creation/access in `index-vault-integration.mjs`
   - Family sharing operations
   - Memory/storage operations

2. **Phase 2**: Implement proper authentication middleware
   ```javascript
   // Middleware to set user context for RLS
   async function setUserContext(req, res, next) {
     const deviceId = req.headers['x-device-id'];
     const userJWT = await generateUserJWT(deviceId);
     req.supabaseAuth = supabase.auth.setSession(userJWT);
     next();
   }
   ```

3. **Phase 3**: Remove unnecessary service client usage
   - Keep service client only for legitimate admin operations
   - System maintenance, cleanup, statistics
   - Webhook processing

### Long-term Improvements (Priority 3)

1. **Database-First Security**
   - Move all authorization logic to RLS policies
   - Simplify application code
   - Improve security auditability

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Monitor RLS policy violations
   - Alert on service client usage for user operations
   - Regular security audits

## Compliance Impact

Current implementation violates:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Service client has excessive permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Single layer of security (application logic only)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business and security logic mixed

## Conclusion

While the RLS policies are well-designed, they provide **zero security benefit** in the current implementation due to systematic bypassing. This creates a false sense of security while leaving the application vulnerable to data breaches.

**Recommendation**: Treat this as a **Priority 1 security issue** requiring immediate remediation.
